\section{Results}

The two final formulas we derived describe the \textit{energy transferred} and
the  \textit{energy  dissipated}  and  are listed  here  again,  respectively.

\begin{align}
    e_{C_2} &= \frac{1}{2}\frac{C_1^2C_2}{\left(C_1+C_2\right)^2}{\Delta V}^2 + \Delta V\cdot V_{0,C_2}\frac{C_1C_2}{C_1+C_2} \label{eq:capacitor-energy2} \\
    e_R     &= \frac{1}{2}\frac{C_1C_2}{C_1+C_2}{\Delta V}^2 \label{eq:resistor-energy2}
\end{align}

If we assume that $C_2$ is discharged ($V_{0,C_2} = 0$) and that $C_1=C_2$, we
get  the  surprising  result  that a quarter  of  the  transferred  energy  is
dissipated  on  the  resistor, \textbf{regardless of the resistor}. This turns
out to be half of  the  total  amount  of  initial  energy,  if  you take into
consideration that $C_1$ will have the same charge  as $C_2$ after the circuit
has settled.

\begin{align}
    \frac{e_{C_2}}{e_R} &= \frac{\frac{1}{2}\frac{C_1^2C_2}{\left(C_1+C_2\right)^2}\Delta V^2}{\frac{1}{2}\frac{C_1C_2}{C_1+C_2}\Delta V^2} \\
                        &= \frac{C_1}{C_1+C_2} \\
                        &= \frac{1}{2}
\end{align}

This  is an efficiency of \SI{33}{\percent}. However, this is  only  the  case
when $C_1=C_2$.

To get an idea of how much energy is lost  with different sized capacitors, we
can calculate a  ``transfer  efficiency''  factor  by dividing the energy that
arrives  at  $C_2$  ($e_{C_2}$)  by  the total amount  of  transferred  energy
($e_{C_2}  + e_R$) for  different  ratios  of  $r=\frac{C_2}{C_1}$.  That  is:

\begin{equation}
    \eta(r) = \frac{e_{C_2}}{e_{C_2} + e_R}
\end{equation}

The    resulting    efficiency    function    can    be    seen   in    figure
\ref{fig:transfer-efficiency}.

\end{figure}

From  this  graph  we  see   that   for  $C_1=C_2$,  the  resistor  dissipates
\SI{33}{\percent} of the energy. As the  value  of  $C_2$  grows  larger  than
$C_1$, more and more energy is dissipated on $R$ versus being transferred into
$C_2$.

As the value of $C_2$ grows smaller  than $C_1$, the energy transfer gets more
and  more  efficient, peaking at a theoretical maximum  of  \SI{50}{\percent}.
