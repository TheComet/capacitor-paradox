\section{Introduction}

The  \textit{Capacitor Paradox} is a  widely  known  trick  question  commonly
encountered in the field of electronics, especially on  internet  forums,  and
sometimes even in electrical engineering lectures, designed  to  throw  people
off.

Consider   two   capacitors,   $C_1   =  \SI{1}{\micro\farad}$  and   $C_2   =
\SI{1}{\micro\farad}$, with initial voltages of $V_{0,C_1}=\SI{10}{\volt}$ and
$V_{0,C_2}=\SI{0}{\volt}$, respectively.

The energy stored in $C_1$ is

\begin{equation}
    e_{C_1} = \frac{1}{2} C_1 V_{0,C_1}^2 = \SI{50}{\micro\joule}
\end{equation}

Now,  close  the switch $S_1$ and let the circuit settle. Since $C_1=C_2$, the
charge from $C_1$ will evenly distribute over both capacitors  such  that both
voltages come to be $V_{settle} = \SI{5}{\volt}$.

Calculating the new energy stored in both capacitors reveals something strange:

\begin{align}
    e_{settle} &= 2\left(\frac{1}{2} C_1 V_{settle}\right) \\
               &= 2\cdot\SI{12.5}{\micro\joule} \\
               &= \SI{25}{\micro\joule} \\
\end{align}

The  new  total energy $e_{settle}$ is \textbf{half} of what  it  was  before.
Where did the energy go?
