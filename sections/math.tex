\section{A Closer Look}

The  circuit  presented  in  figure  \ref{fig:two-caps} represents not only  a
physical impossibility, but  a mathematical impossibility as well (more on the
latter later). If one tried to simulate this  circuit,  one would realise that
an infinite amount of current would have flow in zero time, not to mention the
switch  would  have  to close infinitely quickly and have no resistive losses.

A more  realistic  model is one that at least tries to model the imperfections
of the switch and is shown in figure \ref{fig:circuit}.

\begin{circuitikz} \draw
    (0,0) to[C=$C_1$,v<=$V_{0,C_1}$,i=$i(t)$] (0,3)
          to[spst]                            (1.5,3)
          to[R=$R$,v=$V_R$,i=$i(t)$]          (4,3)
          to[C=$C_2$,v=$V_{0,C_2}$,i>=$i(t)$] (4,0)
          to                                  (0,0)
    ;
\end{circuitikz}

\end{figure}

This new model at least gets rid  of the mathematical impossibility and allows
us  to  analyse  the  circuit  in  more  detail.  There  are  two  approaches.
