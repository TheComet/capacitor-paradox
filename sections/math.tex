\section{A Closer Look}

The circuit presented in  figure  \ref{fig:two-caps}  represents  not  only  a
physical  impossibility, but a mathematical impossibility as well (more on the
latter later). If one  tried  to simulate this circuit, one would realise that
an infinite amount of current would have to flow in zero  time, not to mention
the switch would have  to  close  infinitely  quickly  and  have  no resistive
losses.

A more  realistic  model is one that models the imperfections
of the switch and is shown in figure \ref{fig:circuit}.

This new model at least gets rid  of the mathematical impossibility and allows
us  to  analyse  the  circuit  in  more  detail.  There  are  two  approaches.
